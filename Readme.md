### 1. Proyect description

<br>

<p>Bike Anonymous is an integral management platform which allows an administrator / owner of the same to carry out the management of federated cyclists.<br>
Through the platform, the administrator / owner will be able to perform various actions such as creating their own account, registering federated cyclists, obtaining a report via email of the registered cyclists on the last night, etc ... <br>
This platform will also allow federated cyclists to download their license on the fly so that in case they need it urgently, they can have it.
In short, it is a comprehensive management platform.<br>
This application has been programmed trying to respect SOLID principles.</p>

### 2. Layers description<br><br>

- Domain/core<br>

  <p>This layer represents our domain, our main entities.<br>
  Here we name our business, for example, what is a cyclist, what is an owner, what properties should they have, etc ...<br>
  Normally we will find an entity for each table in our database and they will have the same validation rules as the fields in the database.<br>
  Defining this layer correctly is very important since we will build our application on the data model that we define here.<br>
  All data that comes from outside our system and enters it, if it is necessary to store it, will have to be converted to a model of our domain and pass the validation rules that we have defined, otherwise, said information must be rejected.<br>
  With this we avoid contaminating our database with spurious data and incidentally avoid errors in our application.</p>
  <br>

- DataLayer/DataAcces<br>
    <p>This layer represents data access.<br>
    Defining this layer is a correct idea in the sense that it abstracts us from how we obtain the data in our application.<br>
    For example, if we used an ORM as an entity framework, we could define a new project with all the configuration of the entity framework and its entities and through this layer use all the power of the entity,
    or conversely, you could decide to use an object-oriented database like MongoDB.<br>
    For this example we have used plain text json files as the data storage system, but if we wanted to change it, we would simply have to reprogram only this layer, not affecting the rest of the application layers.<br>
    The important idea or concept to understand here is that we abstract ourselves into a data access layer, we can rest assured if in the future we want to change the data persistence system of our application since we will only have to work on this layer.<br>
    It is an essential condition that this layer works only with the models of our domain, that is, all the methods of ALL the interfaces that are programmed in this layer must receive models of our domain for both reading and writing operations.</p>
  <br>

- Infraestructure<br>
  <p>This layer represents our transversal services, that is, common services that can be used from the other layers, except from our core / domain layer, which should not have references to the other projects in the solution.<br>
  Typically you will have few references to the other projects in the solution.<br>
  In the case of our application, here we have programmed various services such as: TokenGenerator, service for sending emails, the generator of documents in pdf format, etc ...</p>
  <br>

- Application<br>
  <p>
  This layer is where we will program the application commands or the well-known use cases.<br>
  We will have one command per action.<br>
  Normally I usually group the commands in separate projects, such as all the commands that an owner can execute would go in one project, the commands that a cyclist can execute would go in another project and so on.<br>
  It is really here, relying on the other cups where we program our business logic, for example, if we need to create an owner we will invoke the createOwner command and this command will rely on the repository layer to store data.<br>
  We try to respect the Single Responsibility principle, one command per action.</p>
  <br>
- Presentation<br>
  <p>This layer, as its name suggests, is the one that presents the data to the outside and receives the data from the outside.<br>
  It is the entry and exit point to our data system.<br>
  Normally, the other projects in the application should not have references to this project.<br>
  All the inputs that we receive from the outside, if they are going to be stored in our database, they must be converted to a model of our domain because as we said before, our application layer (our commands) can only receive models from our domain to pass them on to the repository layer.<br>
  With this we ensure that spurious data does not enter our system.<br>
  If, for example, it were necessary to perform a read operation through a specific command to return a data model that is not representable through our domain models, our command could simply read through the repository layer the entities we need and then perform a data projection to adapt the output to what the presentation layer needs.<br>
  This is known as DTO data models (data transfer objects).</p>

### 3. How to start the application

<br>

First of all you have to have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17) IDE installed in your computer, then, once you have done it, you have to clone the project from [here](https://github.com/scrafy/BikesAnonymous.git).

Go to the project folder a double click on BikesAnonymous.sln solution file and the project will be opened in Visual Studio.
After that, if you want to execute the application, click on the green play button which is placed on top of the IDE큦 window and a swagger interface will be showned automatically in order to you can invoke the backend methods and enjoy with this wonderfull application :)

### 4. Invoking methods using swagger UI

<br>
Invoking methods using Swagger interfaces is very easy. The first thing you have to decide is if you want to invoke either owner큦 methods or cyclist큦 methods beacuse depending of this, you will have to use one authentication method or another one
